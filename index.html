                    My name is Rossella,
                    <br><br>
                    I'm currently <strong>Batch Manager for Le Wagon</strong> in Barcelona, Spain. This means I make sure my students in the Web Dev batch are doing fine,  teachers and TAs are coordinated, and calendar is always up to date and organized.
                    I'm also <strong>Teacher Assistant</strong>, which involves supporting the students whenever they get stuck while coding, in Ruby, JS and Rails.
                    <br><br>
                    I also keep my other job as <strong>Language Teacher for Connor</strong>, a language school based in Milano, Italy.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm very curious and passionate about people, languages, coding, understanding the why of things and in general making things look tidy and pretty, either in my mind, in someone else’s through teaching or on the web, and that’s I guess why I find playing with Figma and CSS so calming and generally fun.
